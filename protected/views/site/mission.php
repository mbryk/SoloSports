<div class="mid-well">
    <p>Hey, I'm Mark Bryk. This is just an idea I had a while ago, and sketched out in a fancy-shmancy artsy notebook.</p>
    <p>I decided I'd prefer to work on this than some other poser's site, like Pinbooster or AlephBeta which I spent my summer building.</p>
    <p>Since I feel sort-of interested by start-ups, I figured I'd see where this takes me.</p>
    <p>For some more insight into my life, check out <a href="http://www.markbryk.in/">my site</a>, although truthfully, I'm not really spending any time developing it.</p>
    So... <a href="#">Take the Tour.</a>
